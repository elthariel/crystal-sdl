===========

Better Crystal bindings for SDL.

**NOTE**: You **MUST** recompile Crystal **without** the native SDL bindings, otherwise **segfaults will occur**. Simply remove the SDL files from a fresh clone of the Crystal source code and compiling should be enough.

# Samples:

* test - Recommended minimum for working with SDL in Crystal.

* beachball - PyGame inspired sprite demo for a beachball image bouncing against the edges of the window.

* breakout

* Tetris - PyGame inspired tetris clone.
