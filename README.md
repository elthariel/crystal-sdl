===========

Better Crystal bindings for SDL.

**NOTE**: You **MUST** recompile Crystal **without** the native SDL bindings, otherwise **segfaults will occur**. Simply remove the SDL files from a fresh clone of the Crystal source code and compiling should be enough.

# Samples:

* test - Recommended minimum for working with SDL in Crystal.

* beachball - PyGame inspired sprite demo for [a beachball image bouncing against the edges of the window.](http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/intro/intro.html)

* breakout - PyGame inspired demo, taken from: [Program Arcade Games With Python And Pygame](http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/show_file.php?file=breakout_simple.py)

* tetris - PyGame inspired tetris clone.
